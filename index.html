<p class="text-muted text-left">Also designed by Eppstein Uhen Architects, the LEED Platinum-certified Lake Mills Elementary School boasts a newly built children‚Äôs library filled with cubbies, quiet reading areas, wall cut-outs, and plenty of books as well as group activity spaces and movable furniture. This flexible learning environment benefits staff and students who can arrange the space to meet their specific learning needs. The interior design of the library reflects the natural world outside with brightly colored walls for the sky, white lighting for the clouds, winding bookshelves for the rivers, and earthy toned flooring.</p>

<p class="text-muted text-left">When the thirteen acoustic banners are raised out of the way, the Performance Hall auditorium looks like this. In other words, it'll look prettiest for acoustic occasions. Photo by Justin Turveen. The new City Performance Hall in Dallas' Arts District debuts this Friday with an evening of live music. But before the concerts and opening ceremonies, the hall's acoustics are being measured and tested. KERA's Jerome Weeks checks in with the people checking out the hall's sound. KERA radio story: The acoustics of any performance hall are key to its success. Look at -- or listen to -- the Meyerson Symphony Center. But the Meyerson was designed primarily for symphony concerts. That's what it does. The new City Performance Hall, in contrast, is at the other extreme. It will have to accommodate everything from jazz groups and lecture series to dance companies. One way it'll do that is up here, in the attic of the new hall. We're climbing over pipes and I-beams on a steeply sloping floor.</p>

<p class="text-muted text-left">STATEN ISLAND, N.Y. -- A tour through the beautiful St. Peter‚Äôs R.C. Church with Glen Umberger, an architectural historian and manager of special projects at N.Y. Landmarks Conservancy, gives us insight into the history and the different types of architecture used throughout the years of the church‚Äôs creation and growth.

Sitting tall on the hill, St. Peter‚Äôs is called the ‚Äòmother‚Äô church for Staten Island Catholics. Bishop John Dubois established it in March 1839. St. Peter‚Äôs Church is the oldest of the 36 Roman Catholic parishes on Staten Island. The first Mass was celebrated in April 1839 in a local gun factory. As the space became too small and inappropriate, the land on Carroll Place became available. Father Madrano, who arrived in March 1839 from Spain, was the first St. Peter‚Äôs pastor. The land on Carroll Place was donated to the church by the New Brighton Association. It was then dedicated by Bishop John Hughes in September 1844.

The Rev. John Shanahan was the second pastor in 1845, and the third was the Rev. James Roosevelt Bayley, nephew of Elizabeth Ann Seton and future Archbishop of Baltimore. The original church burned down in the late 1890s. The new church was completed by Thanksgiving Day, 1903. It was built directly on top of the salvaged remains of the old church. The builders carefully matched the old brick with the new brick to create a seamless vision of the grand church.

The current church building was designed by the firm of Harding and Gooch in neo-Romanesque style with Gothic accents. Its construction took from 1900 to 1903.

French Gothic in style, the church's vaulted ceiling that towers high above the worshipers is so expertly constructed that no interior columns are necessary. Hence, the view from every corner of the church is unobstructed.

Many of the stained-glass windows added intense color to the cathedral-like interior, which was created at Franz Mayer & Co., a German stained glass design and manufacturing company, based in Munich, Germany, that still exists today. "The stained glass craftsmanship is truly remarkable," according to Umberger. The onyx and brass altar rail was imported from Italy, and the Stations of the Cross came from France. ‚ÄúThe church truly has a great European feel due to all of the different countries‚Äô imports,‚Äù said Umberger.

The Benziger family, for which Benziger Avenue was named, contributed to the main altar.

The clock tower can be seen from far away and is undoubtedly a Staten Island landmark.

St. Peter‚Äôs R.C. Church celebrated its 175th anniversary in 2014. In 2015 the Church of the Assumption and St. Paul‚Äôs R.C. Churches merged with St. Peter‚Äôs R.C. Church.

This splendid church was built to inspire and lift the Catholic congregation on Staten Island and all who entered. Indeed, it continues to do so today, especially during the Christmas season.</p>

<p class="list-group-item-text col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12">The school office is open Monday through Friday 7:00 a.m. ‚Äì 3:30 p.m. As a public school, we maintain a campus that is open to visitors who have a purpose for being on campus and whose presence is in no way disruptive to the instructional program or other school operational procedures. All visitors must sign in at the office and receive a visitor‚Äôs badge. As a reminder, CNUSD uses the Raptor Management System.  Once the front desk staff scans the identification provided, Raptor checks the name against registered sex offender lists nationwide. Once you have been cleared through Raptor, the system will print a visitor badge with your name, picture and destination. You will not be required to complete this process if you are simply dropping off an item in the office or picking something up. However, if the purpose of your visit is to visit a location on campus, or volunteer in a classroom, you will need to go through this process. This security procedure is district-wide to help ensure the safety of all students and staff. Our goal is to continue to provide a welcoming and warm environment for our parents, students and staff while simultaneously communicating a culture of safety and security to the community. Persons not listed on the emergency card may be denied access.

Parents and children not enrolled at Lincoln Fundamental are not permitted on the playground at any time.  The school campus is closed to non-school personnel before and after school. If you wish to visit or volunteer in a classroom, please sign up with your teacher in the upcoming week.  Classroom teachers may determine whether they wish to use parent helpers in their classrooms.  A teacher desiring to schedule parent helpers must designate the time and day helpers may come to their classroom. If you wish to meet with your teacher, make an appointment by contacting the teacher at least one day ahead. Preschool or other children not enrolled at our school may not accompany parent visitors or helpers to classrooms or copy rooms due to safety issues and impact to instructional time. Children may attend award assemblies and other select events.

Beginning Monday, August 19th parents must say goodbye to their students at the office or back gates.  Visitors will not be allowed in the hallways or playground area.  If you are volunteering in the classroom, we ask that you proceed immediately to your designated destination after checking in the office.</p>
